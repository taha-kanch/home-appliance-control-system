# home-appliance-control-system
This project showcases real-time state synchronization of home appliances using socket programming with Node.js and React Native. The system simulates a smart home setup with 2 bulbs and 1 fan, where changes in appliance states on one phone are instantly reflected on another connected phone, ensuring real-time synchronization across devices.
